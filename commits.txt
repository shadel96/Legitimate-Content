Have a nice day :)

I work on my programming and educate myself in something new almost every single day, but in what world does that mean I would post it on GitHub every day?

Just because someone isn't doing things the way you expect them to, doesn't mean they're not doing anything

Don't look at someone's commit history as an indication of their worth.
